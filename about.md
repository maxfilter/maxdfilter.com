I'm Max. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Most of my time is spent figuring out how the world works, building things and hanging around outside or with friends. I also enjoy reading, cooking, recording thoughts in my Field Notes, taking pictures and pretending to be a writer. 

## Currently

I'm working as an AI Research Intern at [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html) and finishing up my undergrad in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). 

## Future

I'm passionate about the outdoors and have been learning about computers since my freshman year of college. Though I still haven't decided what my future will be like, I'm determined to combine my interests in a way that benefits others. Maybe in the future I'll design robots capable of surviving extreme environments, or create tools to help scientists, or maybe I've just been reading too much sci-fi... you'll have to wait and see.

Secretly, I have dreams of [backpacking the triple crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking) and working in Antarctica.

## Contact

If you want to catch up, talk, or even just say hi, I'm available by [email](mailto:max.filtercalvo@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxfilter/).

## Friends

Some of these people are close family and friends. Others I haven't met yet, but they write excellent blogs. All people that I find inspiring, though.
