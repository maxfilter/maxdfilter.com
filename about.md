title: Who I am
---

As a kid I always asked questions, motivated by the desire to understand how our world works. Though my interests have shifted over the years, my curiosity remains strong. I built this website as a place to answer questions and document my thoughts. My hope is that these posts will inspire you to think differently about the world we live in and ask more questions.

My competing interests are technology and the outdoors, and right now I'm figuring out how to combine them while simultaneously making a living. I study Computer Science at Virginia Tech, but in my free time love [reading a good book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38789998-max-filter){:target="_blank"}, [getting outside](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3404709){:target="_blank"} [this includes running, biking, hiking, backpacking, ...], and [working on personal projects](https://github.com/maxfilter){:target="_blank"} like this website. Music and coffee get me through each day.
