<p>When I was fourteen, I decided that I wanted to have my own little corner of the internet where I could post my own thoughts and ideas. At the time, I didnâ€™t care if anyone else read them, I just wanted to have a place that I could go back to whenever I wanted to look at my thoughts from a certain period of time. I didnâ€™t know how to make websites and I was afraid to write, because nothing I wrote seemed worthy of existing on the internet.</p>

<p>So my website remained a seedling in my mind.</p>

<p>Flash forward to the summer of 2018.  I had just finished my freshman year of college and decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science. I still had no idea how to make websites, but I decided that I would never learn unless I forced myself to put in the time and energy. Over the course of the summer, I worked through the WW3 school tutorials on HTML and CSS, and by the end of the summer my first website was live. I didnâ€™t know how to create a blog, so all it contained was an about section, a map of the places Iâ€™d travelled to, and some links to social media sites.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the first semester of my sophomore year, the idea of creating a blog was still hanging around in the back of my mind. I knew how to make simple websites, and with the discovery of Jekyll, I learned that I could use that knowledge to build my own blog, writing posts in markdown rather than HTML.  Also, much of the design came from looking at other peopleâ€™s blogs. It was a learning experience, but it didnâ€™t yet feel like my own little corner of the internet.</p>

<p>Over spring break sophomore year, I created a  yet another iteration of my website. This one included different categories of posts, and posts could be filtered into photography and writing. I was getting closer and I actually posted a few things onto it over the course of the summer, but it felt a little to complicated.</p>

<p>This brings me to my current version of this website. I wanted something simple, with a focus on the content. I guess what Iâ€™m really trying to create is a time capsule. I feel like Iâ€™m a completely different person than I was when I first dreamed of creating a website, and I wonder who Iâ€™ll be five years from now. My mind exists on a continuum and is ever changing, and I see this as a way to record my thoughts in the moment.</p>

<p>One day, I hope, Iâ€™ll be able to dig these posts up and see how my thoughts have changed over time, and get some insight into who I was as a person during various points in my life. Iâ€™m not a very good writer, and Iâ€™ve always liked to look back at my older work and reflect on how Iâ€™ve changed as a person. This is the place where that will happen. So, welcome to my time capsule.</p>
