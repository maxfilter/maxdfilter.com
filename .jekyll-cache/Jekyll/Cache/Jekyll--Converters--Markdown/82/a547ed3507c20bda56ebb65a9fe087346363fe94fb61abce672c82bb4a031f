I"ş'<p>Chris Hadfield is down-to-Earth, humble, honest, accomplished, andâ€”among many other thingsâ€”has a fantastic sense of humor, making this a fascinating read filled with valuable life lessons. I appreciate that he doesnâ€™t sugarcoat the more unpleasant aspects of space, yet still finds a way to put a positive spin on them. He knew that the odds of going to space were extremely low, so his sense of personal fulfillment was never based on that. Big themes throughout his life have been the square astronaut round hole dilemma, sweating (and enjoying) the small stuff, and aiming to be a zero.</p>

<p><strong>Veridct:</strong> Highly recommend.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Square astronaut, round hole</em> is about â€œtrying to figure out where I want to go when just getting out the door seems impossibleâ€, referencing how awkward getting out the door for a space walk can be, when we often imagine it as being graceful.</li>
  <li>You arenâ€™t destined to achieve your goals, you have to actively work towards them. Fortunately, you can start immediately by imagining what the person you want to become would do. Astronaut core skill of being able â€œto parse and solve complex problems rapidly, with incomplete information, in a hostile environmentâ€ is not something theyâ€™re born with, itâ€™s developed on the job.</li>
  <li><strong>Hadfield mindset on becoming an astronaut:</strong> â€œItâ€™s probably not going to happen, but I should do things that keep me moving in the right direction, just in caseâ€”and I should be sure those things interest me, so that whatever happens, Iâ€™m happy.â€</li>
  <li>Big part of expeditions is learning to develop new instincts, ways of thinking, and habits.</li>
  <li><strong>Competence</strong> is necessary for anyone who strives to succeed at anything. It means â€œkeeping your head in a crisis, sticking with a task even when it seems hopeless, and improvising good solutions to tough problems when every second counts. It encompasses ingenuity, determination and being prepared for anything.â€</li>
  <li>Attitude that CH might never go to space, or ever go back after he did, helped keep his 20+ year career satisfying. Keeps CH headed in the right direction and is the #1 thing you can control.</li>
  <li><strong>Success</strong> is â€œfeeling good about the work you do throughout the long, unheralded journey that may or may not wind up at the launch padâ€.</li>
  <li>â€œBe ready. Work. Hard. Enjoy it!â€</li>
  <li><strong>Hadfield on training:</strong> â€œwe learn how to do things that contribute in a very small way to a much larger mission but do absolutely nothing for our own career prospects. We spend our days studying and simulating experiences we may never actually haveâ€.</li>
  <li>Learning is the point.</li>
  <li><strong>Power of negative thinking:</strong> Good way to boost confidence is to simulate and engage fully with disaster. CH thinks through what to do if things go wrong.</li>
  <li>Work astronauts do is far more important than they are as individuals.</li>
  <li>If striving for excellence, no such thing as over-preparation.</li>
  <li><strong>Viewing criticism as potentially helpful</strong> rather than a personal attack is a big plus in any field.</li>
  <li>Insert beautiful space description here.</li>
  <li>â€œ<strong>Early success</strong> is a terrible teacher. Youâ€™re essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you canâ€™t do it. You donâ€™t know howâ€.</li>
  <li><strong>Expeditionary behavior</strong> choose whatâ€™s best for the group, donâ€™t choose to wallow in misery.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t complainâ€”itâ€™s contagious and unproductive.</li>
  <li>Big life lessons:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Never ridicule a colleague, even with an offhand remark, no matter how tempting it is or how hilarious the laugh line.</em></li>
      <li><em>Donâ€™t snap at the people who work with you. When you see red, count to 10.</em></li>
      <li><em>The more senior you are, the greater the impact your flippant comment will have.</em></li>
      <li><em>Focus on the journey, not on arriving at a certain destination. Keep looking to the future, not mourning the past.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As astronaut, not much free time, so when you have it you need to â€œmake choices that clearly communicate gratitude to your family and a desire to see them, on their terms, every once in a whileâ€.</li>
  <li>Have a plan that breaks down what you want to do into small, concrete steps.</li>
  <li>â€œThereâ€™s nothing more important than what youâ€™re doing right nowâ€ and ask â€œwhat could kill me nextâ€.</li>
  <li>On elevator, guy expected others to press button for him bc he felt that he was above them. If you think of yourself as An Astronaut, A Doctor, A Whatever and act that way everyone else sees you as that arrogant guy, craving significance.</li>
  <li><strong>Aim to be zero, even if you are a plus one</strong> â€œYou will almost certainly be viewed in one of three ways. As a minus one: actively harmful, someone who creates problems. Or as a zero: your impact is neutral and doesnâ€™t tip the balance one way or the other. Or youâ€™ll be seen as a plus one: someone who actively adds valueâ€. Be quietly competent and helpful. If needed, be there in an instant, but never elbow others out of the way and make others feel small. Donâ€™t have to tell anyone if youâ€™re a plus one, theyâ€™ll already know.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>On new environments:</strong> Best way to contribute is â€œnot by trying to prove what a wonderful addition you are. Itâ€™s by trying to have a neutral impact, to observe and learn from those who are already there, and to pitch in with the grunt work wherever possibleâ€.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The reason is simple: people are inherently interested in other people. They care about the big picture, yes, but theyâ€™re enthralled by the human aspects of space exploration, the minutiae of daily life on board the ISS. Understandably, then, the most popular videos we made were the ones about everyday space oddities.</li>
  <li>Life is full of so many small, unexpected pleasures, not just in space but right here on Earth, and I think I see them more clearly now than I used to because microgravity insists you pay attention.</li>
  <li>A lot of times the work isnâ€™t glamorous, but thatâ€™s okay. The workplace itself is, after all, in a pretty great location.</li>
  <li>Loneliness, I think, has very little to do with location. Itâ€™s a state of mind. In the center of every big, bustling city are some of the loneliest people in the world.</li>
  <li>But fundamentally, life off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly: You can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures, or the frustrations. And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones.</li>
  <li>Ultimately, the real question is whether you want to be happy.</li>
  <li>I was taking 100 pictures a day and starting to develop a better eye. I was learning what to look for: weird colors and textures, discontinuities and surprising shapes, like the island off Turkey that looks, from space, like an exclamation point, or the river in Brazil that looks just like the â€œSâ€ on Supermanâ€™s chest.</li>
  <li>All this went through my head and heart for a minute or two, then I made a resolution: I was not going to hint that Iâ€™d had this pang of envy, or say, even once, that I wished I was doing the EVA.</li>
  <li>Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. Itâ€™s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for othersâ€™ success, and then standing back and letting them shine.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s tempting to tell yourself, â€œIâ€™ve only got 20 steps left,â€ but if you start anticipating the finish line, chances are that youâ€™ll let up and then you could make mistakesâ€”ones that could be fatal in my line of work.</li>
  <li>But the reason the question bothered me was the implication that space flight was the last worthwhile experience Iâ€™d ever have, and sadly, from here on in, it was all downhill. I donâ€™t look at myself or the world that way. I view each mission as just one thread in the overall fabric of my lifeâ€”which is, I hope, nowhere near over.</li>
  <li>If you start thinking that only your biggest and shiniest moments count, youâ€™re setting yourself up to feel like a failure most of the time.</li>
  <li>Personally, Iâ€™d rather feel good most of the time, so to me everything counts: the small moments, the medium ones, the successes that make the papers and also the ones that no one knows about but me.</li>
  <li>The spotlight moves on, and astronauts need to, too. If you canâ€™t, youâ€™ll wind up hobbled by self-importance or by the fear that nothing else you do will ever measure up.</li>
  <li>But we make matters infinitely worse through poor stewardship. We need to take a longer-term view of the environment and try to make things better wherever we can.</li>
  <li>This turns out to be one of the little-known aftereffects of space flight: I now pick gum wrappers up off the street.</li>
  <li>The whole process of becoming an astronaut helped me understand that what really matters is not the value someone else assigns to a task but how I personally feel while performing it.</li>
  <li>The truth is that I find every day fulfilling, whether Iâ€™m on the planet or off it. I work hard at whatever Iâ€™m doing, whether itâ€™s fixing a bilge pump in my boat or learning to play a new song on the guitar. And I find satisfaction in small things, like playing Scrabble online with my daughter, Kristinâ€”we always have a game goingâ€”or reading a letter from a first grader who wants to be an astronaut, or picking gum wrappers up off the street.</li>
  <li>Endings donâ€™t have to be emotionally wrenching if you believe you did a good job and youâ€™re prepared to let go.</li>
