I"»<p>As a kid I always asked questions, motivated by the desire to understand how our world works. Though my interests have shifted over the years, my curiosity remains strong. I built this website as a place to answer questions and document my thoughts. My hope is that these posts will inspire you to think differently about the world we live in and ask more questions.</p>

<p>My competing interests are technology and the outdoors, and right now Iâ€™m figuring out how to combine them while simultaneously making a living. I study Computer Science at Virginia Tech, but in my free time love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38789998-max-filter">reading a good book</a>, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/3404709">getting outside</a> [this includes running, biking, hiking, backpacking, â€¦], and <a href="https://github.com/maxfilter">working on personal projects</a> like this website. Music and coffee get me through each day.</p>
