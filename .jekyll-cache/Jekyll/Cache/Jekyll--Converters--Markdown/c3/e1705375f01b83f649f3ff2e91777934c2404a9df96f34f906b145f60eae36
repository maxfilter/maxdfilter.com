I"ë<p>When I was fourteen, I decided that I wanted to have my own little corner of the internet where I could post my own thoughts and ideas. At the time, I didnâ€™t care if anyone else read them, I just wanted to have a place that I could go back to whenever I wanted to look at my thoughts from a certain period of time. I didnâ€™t know how to make websites and I was afraid to write, because nothing I wrote seemed worthy of existing on the internet.</p>

<p>So my website remained a seedling in my mind.</p>

<p>Flash forward to the summer of 2018.  I had just finished my freshman year of college and decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science. I still had no idea how to make websites, but I decided that I would never learn unless I forced myself to put in the time and energy. Over the course of the summer, I worked through the W3 Schools tutorials on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a>, and by August my first website was live. I didnâ€™t know how to create a blog, so all it had was an about section, a map of the places Iâ€™d travelled to, and some links to social media sites.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the first semester of my sophomore year, the idea of creating a blog was still in the back of my mind. I discovered Jekyll and markdown, and with that I was able to make a website with a blog; however, much of the design came from looking at other blogs. It was a learning experience, but it didnâ€™t yet feel like my own little corner of the internet.</p>

<p>Over spring break sophomore year, I created a  yet another iteration of my website. This one included a filter to sort posts into photography or writing types.I actually posted a few things onto it over the course of the summer, and I felt like I was getting closer to having my own blog.</p>

<p>This brings me to the current version of this website. I wanted something simple that emphasized the content. I know now that what Iâ€™m really trying to create is a time capsule. I feel like Iâ€™m a completely different person than I was when I first dreamed of creating a website, and I wonder who Iâ€™ll be five years from now. My mind exists on a continuum and is ever changing, and I see this as a way to record my thoughts in the moment.</p>

<p>One day, I hope Iâ€™ll be able to dig these posts up and see how my thoughts have changed over time, and get some insight into who I was as a person during various points in my life. Iâ€™m not a very good writer, and Iâ€™ve always liked to look back at my older work and reflect on how Iâ€™ve changed as a person. This is the place where that will happen. So, welcome to my time capsule.</p>

<p>I love the outdoors as much as I love technology and wanted that to be more prominent across my site.</p>
