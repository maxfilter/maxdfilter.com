<p>No matter where on Earth, your body will always be experiencing the present moment with all of its emotions, sensations and sounds. Each instant increments the infinite number of moments that make up time and the likelihood of everything existing once again as it did in that moment is essentially zero,meaning that the world will never again be as it was while you read this sentence.</p>

<p>I remember thinking about this once while I was backpacking under the August heat in New Mexicoâ€“the night before was cool and I wanted nothing more than to have the Sun come back up, but as the Sun rose and the heat returned the crisp air was nothing more than a distant memory. Sensation is limited to the present moment and our bodies are very good at experiencing the world as it is. We take for granted the fact that when we see something like a laptop, we know that we can reach forward and feel it too, and then hear the clicking of the keys as we type.</p>

<p>While the body is trapped in the present moment, I find it fascinating that our mind and thoughts are free to move through time as they please. We have the ability to recall events that happened throughout our lives and imagination takes us even farther back so that when you look at a fossil you can empathize with the living being it once represented.</p>

<p>Even more amazing is the fact that we can think forward in time, planning out each day and thinking of what the distant future might be like, albeit not very well because we often donâ€™t think about how our present moment impacts the future when it comes to topics that are bigger than ourselves such as climate change.</p>

<p>Because our mind has the ability to travel through time in ways that our body cannot (yet), I feel that we as a species spend a lot of the time thinking only about the future and past, and maybe neglecting the present. While our ability to learn from mistakes and plan ahead is arguably a key trait that has kept us alive this long, I think we could learn something if we paid more attention to this instant.</p>

<p>The difficult part about living in the moment is not being physically present. Rather, itâ€™s about making yourself conscious of your surroundings, being able to absorb all of the emotions and sensations that your brain is receiving right at this very moment and being aware of the fact that this experience that you just had will never happen again, so savor the present while you are in it.</p>
