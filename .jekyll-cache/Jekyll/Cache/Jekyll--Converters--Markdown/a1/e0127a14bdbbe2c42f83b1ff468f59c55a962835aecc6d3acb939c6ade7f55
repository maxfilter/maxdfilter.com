I"π5<p>Chris Hadfield is humble, inspiring and has a fantastic sense of humor. I was expecting a light read with this book, but quickly realized that there was a pretty heavy life lesson on every other page. I enjoyed how honest Hadfield was‚Äìhe didn‚Äôt sugarcoat the unpleasant things, but at the same time he managed to find a positive twist to them‚Äìlike how he was disappointed about not being able to do the EVA in 2012, but quickly turned it around and wrote about how he knew that he was not the most qualified candidate and wanted to do everything he could to ensure the success of his crew.</p>

<p>Astronauts seem like incredibly down to Earth people, and I would love to meet one someday. The way NASA moves them down the ladder of importance as soon as the mission is over, the way that they support each other, it‚Äôs all pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Hadfield knew he wanted to be an astronaut when he was 9, and acted with determination from that point on. He also knew that it was incredibly difficult to become an astronaut (impossible in Canada, when his dream first started), so he made a point of not basing his self worth on that single goal. Even after he became one, he still had over twenty years of constant learning and there was no guarantee that he would ever go to space.</p>

<p>It makes me want to consider my goals and try to find a mission I can work towards, while at the same time being aware enough to feel happy with the present moment. After Atomic Habits, this drives home the idea that we should focus on and enjoy the little things if we want to see big changes in our happiness and productivity. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and wants to get an interesting perspective on life.</p>

  <li>Square astronaut, round hole. It‚Äôs the story of my life, really: trying to figure out how to get where I want to go when just getting out the door seems impossible.</li>
  <li>I wasn‚Äôt destined to be an astronaut. I had to turn myself into one.</li>
  <li>I could get started immediately. Would an astronaut eat his vegetables or have potato chips instead? Sleep in late or get up early to read a book?</li>
  <li>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably not going to happen, but I should do things that keep me moving in the right direction, just in case‚Äîand I should be sure those things interest me, so that whatever happens, I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Expedition 34/35 was the pinnacle of my career, and the culmination of years of training‚Äînot just training to develop specific job-related skills, like piloting a Soyuz, but training to develop new instincts, new ways of thinking, new habits.</li>
  <li>The upshot of all this is that we become competent, which is the most important quality to have if you‚Äôre an astronaut‚Äîor, frankly, anyone, anywhere, who is striving to succeed at anything at all.</li>
  <li>Competence means keeping your head in a crisis, sticking with a task even when it seems hopeless, and improvising good solutions to tough problems when every second counts. It encompasses ingenuity, determination and being prepared for anything.</li>
  <li>Taking the attitude that I might never get to space‚Äîand then, after I did get there, that I might never go back‚Äîhelped me hold onto that feeling for more than two decades.</li>
  <li>Success is feeling good about the work you do throughout the long, unheralded journey that may or may not wind up at the launch pad.</li>
  <li>really just one thing I can control: my attitude during the journey, which is what keeps me feeling steady and stable, and what keeps me headed in the right direction.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúBe ready. Work. Hard. Enjoy it!‚Äù</li>
  <li>A lot of our training is like this: we learn how to do things that contribute in a very small way to a much larger mission but do absolutely nothing for our own career prospects. We spend our days studying and simulating experiences we may never actually have.</li>
  <li>that, I think, is the point: learning.</li>
  <li>Nothing boosts confidence quite like simulating a disaster, engaging with it fully, both physically and intellectually, and realizing you have the ability to work the problem.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve never known an astronaut who doesn‚Äôt believe that the work we do is far more important than we are as individuals.</li>
  <li>Like most astronauts, I‚Äôm pretty sure that I can deal with what life throws at me because I‚Äôve thought about what to do if things go wrong, as well as right. That‚Äôs the power of negative thinking.</li>
  <li>But if you‚Äôre striving for excellence‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs in playing the guitar or flying a jet‚Äîthere‚Äôs no such thing as over-preparation.</li>
  <li>In any field, it‚Äôs a plus if you view criticism as potentially helpful advice rather than as a personal attack.</li>
  <li>That‚Äôs one good thing about habitually sweating the small stuff: you learn to be very, very patient.</li>
  <li>Waiting for him I check behind me, to be sure I haven‚Äôt accidentally activated my backup tank of oxygen, and that‚Äôs when I notice the universe. The scale is graphically shocking. The colors, too. The incongruity is stupefying: there I was, inside a small box, but now‚Äîhow is this possible?</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs overpowering, visually, and no other senses warn you that you‚Äôre about to be attacked by raw beauty.</li>
  <li>On average, new astronauts are 34 years old; wanting the job has driven their choices for many years.</li>
  <li>Early success is a terrible teacher. You‚Äôre essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can‚Äôt do it. You don‚Äôt know how.</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt have a lot of regrets in life, but one of my biggest is that when my son Kyle was about 10 and was proudly demonstrating how many laps he could swim underwater without taking a breath, I jumped in the pool and swam one more length than he did. It was an unthinking moment, and a great demonstration of the destructive power of competitiveness. I didn‚Äôt just show up my child; I risked damaging his self-confidence and our bond.</li>
  <li>This is where expeditionary behavior comes in. You can choose to wallow in misery, or you can focus on what‚Äôs best for the group (hint: it‚Äôs never misery).</li>
  <li>Never ridicule a colleague, even with an offhand remark, no matter how tempting it is or how hilarious the laugh line.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt snap at the people who work with you. When you see red, count to 10.</li>
  <li>The more senior you are, the greater the impact your flippant comment will have.</li>
  <li>focus on the journey, not on arriving at a certain destination. Keep looking to the future, not mourning the past.</li>
  <li>absorbed and engaged in it, and better able to appreciate it as it unfolds rather than in retrospect.</li>
  <li>The reality of an astronaut‚Äôs life is that you travel 70 percent of the time and you don‚Äôt have much say over your own schedule‚Äîso when you do have leeway, you have to make choices that clearly communicate gratitude to your family and a desire to see them, on their terms, every once in a while.</li>
  <li>My point, though, is that saying thank you every once in a while just isn‚Äôt enough when you‚Äôre demanding that other people make real sacrifices so you can pursue your goals. It‚Äôs not only the fun, showy things like vacations that get the message across. You also have to be willing to do what you can to create the conditions that allow your partner the freedom to focus single-mindedly at times.</li>
  <li>Our core skill, the one that made us astronauts‚Äîthe ability to parse and solve complex problems rapidly, with incomplete information, in a hostile environment‚Äîwas not something any of us had been born with. But by this point, we all had it. We‚Äôd developed it on the job.</li>
  <li>Having a plan that breaks down what you‚Äôre going to do into small, concrete steps is the best way I know to bridge that gap.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more important than what you‚Äôre doing right now‚Äù</li>
  <li>For me, it was a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of ever thinking of yourself as An Astronaut (or A Doctor, or A Whatever). To everyone else, you‚Äôre just that arrogant guy on the elevator, craving significance.</li>
  <li>you will almost certainly be viewed in one of three ways. As a minus one: actively harmful, someone who creates problems. Or as a zero: your impact is neutral and doesn‚Äôt tip the balance one way or the other. Or you‚Äôll be seen as a plus one: someone who actively adds value.</li>
  <li>And yet during our course in Utah, he never imposed his expertise on anyone or told us what to do. Instead, he was just quietly competent and helpful. If I needed him, he was there in an instant, but he never elbowed me out of the way to demonstrate his superior skills or made me feel small for not knowing how to do something. Everyone on our team knew that Tom was a plus one. He didn‚Äôt have to tell us.</li>
  <li>The best way to contribute to a brand-new environment is not by trying to prove what a wonderful addition you are. It‚Äôs by trying to have a neutral impact, to observe and learn from those who are already there, and to pitch in with the grunt work wherever possible.</li>
  <li>The reason is simple: people are inherently interested in other people. They care about the big picture, yes, but they‚Äôre enthralled by the human aspects of space exploration, the minutiae of daily life on board the ISS. Understandably, then, the most popular videos we made were the ones about everyday space oddities.</li>
  <li>Life is full of so many small, unexpected pleasures, not just in space but right here on Earth, and I think I see them more clearly now than I used to because microgravity insists you pay attention.</li>
  <li>A lot of times the work isn‚Äôt glamorous, but that‚Äôs okay. The workplace itself is, after all, in a pretty great location.</li>
  <li>Loneliness, I think, has very little to do with location. It‚Äôs a state of mind. In the center of every big, bustling city are some of the loneliest people in the world.</li>
  <li>But fundamentally, life off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly: You can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures, or the frustrations. And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones.</li>
  <li>Ultimately, the real question is whether you want to be happy.</li>
  <li>I was taking 100 pictures a day and starting to develop a better eye. I was learning what to look for: weird colors and textures, discontinuities and surprising shapes, like the island off Turkey that looks, from space, like an exclamation point, or the river in Brazil that looks just like the ‚ÄúS‚Äù on Superman‚Äôs chest.</li>
  <li>All this went through my head and heart for a minute or two, then I made a resolution: I was not going to hint that I‚Äôd had this pang of envy, or say, even once, that I wished I was doing the EVA.</li>
  <li>Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It‚Äôs about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others‚Äô success, and then standing back and letting them shine.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs tempting to tell yourself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only got 20 steps left,‚Äù but if you start anticipating the finish line, chances are that you‚Äôll let up and then you could make mistakes‚Äîones that could be fatal in my line of work.</li>
  <li>But the reason the question bothered me was the implication that space flight was the last worthwhile experience I‚Äôd ever have, and sadly, from here on in, it was all downhill. I don‚Äôt look at myself or the world that way. I view each mission as just one thread in the overall fabric of my life‚Äîwhich is, I hope, nowhere near over.</li>
  <li>If you start thinking that only your biggest and shiniest moments count, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to feel like a failure most of the time.</li>
  <li>Personally, I‚Äôd rather feel good most of the time, so to me everything counts: the small moments, the medium ones, the successes that make the papers and also the ones that no one knows about but me.</li>
  <li>The spotlight moves on, and astronauts need to, too. If you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôll wind up hobbled by self-importance or by the fear that nothing else you do will ever measure up.</li>
  <li>But we make matters infinitely worse through poor stewardship. We need to take a longer-term view of the environment and try to make things better wherever we can.</li>
  <li>This turns out to be one of the little-known aftereffects of space flight: I now pick gum wrappers up off the street.</li>
  <li>The whole process of becoming an astronaut helped me understand that what really matters is not the value someone else assigns to a task but how I personally feel while performing it.</li>
  <li>The truth is that I find every day fulfilling, whether I‚Äôm on the planet or off it. I work hard at whatever I‚Äôm doing, whether it‚Äôs fixing a bilge pump in my boat or learning to play a new song on the guitar. And I find satisfaction in small things, like playing Scrabble online with my daughter, Kristin‚Äîwe always have a game going‚Äîor reading a letter from a first grader who wants to be an astronaut, or picking gum wrappers up off the street.</li>
  <li>Endings don‚Äôt have to be emotionally wrenching if you believe you did a good job and you‚Äôre prepared to let go.</li>
</ul>
