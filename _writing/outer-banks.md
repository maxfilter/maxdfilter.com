Madi's family invited me to spend a week with them in the Outer Banks. 

On the first few days we felt the effects of Hurricane Isaias passing byâ€”I woke up to the sound of the neighborhood's overturned garbage bins dragging across the street, standing on the beach was like standing in a sandblaster, and the waves were angry and choppy.

The water was cold for the first half of the week, warm for the rest. On the days with too many jellyfish we opted to read, get sunburned, and play board games instead. My favorite part was one evening when we got to relax in the ocean and watch the colors change in the sky.

We tried parasailing for the first time. I guess I expected it to be turbulent and stressful, but it turned out to be the exact opposite. Trailing 800 feet behind the boat, the sound of the motor faded away and everything became quiet. The feeling was comparable to sitting on a perfectly still ski lift and watching the clouds moving in the distance while the waves glistened far below.

It was a very boring and leisurely week, which I badly needed. Now it's back to working and getting ready for another semester of Zoom calls.
