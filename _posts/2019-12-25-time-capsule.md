title: Creating a Time Capsule

When I was fourteen, I decided that I wanted to have my own little corner of the internet where I could post my thoughts and ideas. At the time, I didn’t care if anyone else read them, I just wanted to have a place that I could go back to whenever I wanted to read through my thoughts from a certain time. I didn’t know how to make websites and I was afraid to write because nothing I wrote seemed worthy of existing on the internet.

So my website remained a seedling in my mind.

Flash forward to the summer of 2018.  I had just finished my freshman year of college and decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science. I still had no idea how to make websites, but I decided that I would never learn unless I forced myself to put in the time and energy. Over the course of the summer, I worked through the W3 Schools tutorials on [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp){:target="_blank"} and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp){:target="_blank"}, and by August my first website was live. I didn’t know how to create a blog, so all it had was an about section, a map of the places I’d travelled to, and some links to social media sites.

After wrapping up the first semester of my sophomore year, the idea of creating a blog was still in the back of my mind. I discovered Jekyll and markdown, and with that I was finally able to start a blog. It was a learning experience, but still didn’t feel like my own little corner of the internet.

Over spring break sophomore year, I worked on yet another iteration of my website. This one included a filter to sort posts into photography or writing types. I actually posted a few things onto it over the course of the summer, and I felt like I was getting closer to having my own blog.

This brings me to the current version of my website. I wanted something simple that emphasized the content. What I’m really trying to create is a time capsule. I feel like I’m a completely different person than I was when I first dreamed of creating a website, and I wonder who I’ll become five years from now. My mind exists on a continuum and is ever changing, and I see this as a place to record my thoughts in the moment. 

One day, I hope I’ll be able to dig up these posts and see how my thoughts have changed over time, maybe even get some insight into who I was during various points in my life. I’m not a very good writer, and I’ve always liked to look back at my older work and reflect on how I’ve changed as a person. This is the place where that will happen. So, welcome to my time capsule.

## Inspirations

## Why the Random Plants?
I love the outdoors as much as I love technology and wanted that to be prominent on my site.
