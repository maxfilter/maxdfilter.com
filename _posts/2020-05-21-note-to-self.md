When translating thoughts into words, don't over complicate them. 

Like Paul Graham said in his [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html),

> Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.

We have a way of making things sound more difficult than they are.

It's not like this is a novel concept either. Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, and many other great minds also believed keeping things simple to be the most important thing you can do, because it makes complex ideas digestible while preventing simpler ideas from sounding like more than they are.

Also, be patient when writing. Words are one of only a few ways to convey ideas, and rushing it makes the ideas sound like they haven't been well thought out. After writing something, take a break before coming back to read it over. See what can be cut or re-worded to make things as clear as possible.
