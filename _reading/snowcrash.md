This story had a lot of potential, but it fell short in terms of the plot and character development. I had a hard time connecting with the characters because they seemed very superficial and didn't act like real people. As for the plot, I felt like there were elements that weren't clearly explained, like the motives for the villains, pieces of the story that you could tell were thrown in just to set up the next scene (but didn't hold much value on their own) and unrealistic gaps in characters' story lines. Maybe that's a bit harsh, but it made the story hard for me to follow and enjoy. The librarian seemed like a kind of cheap way to reveal the plot, and the whole computers not understanding analogies (but Hiro using them anyway to sound like a hacker genius) got old after the first few times. Though I'm not super interested in the meshing of computer science and religion, I still thought the story brought up some cool ideasâ€”I just wish there was more of a story to go along with them.

**Verdict:** Not my favorite, reminds me of if Dan Brown wrote sci-fi.
