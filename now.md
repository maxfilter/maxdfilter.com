title: What I'm working on

I have a few projects I want to work on, as well as a new business idea I'd like to research. I hope to implement some new habits into my life and I'll be taking some classes in school that I think will be very rewarding.

## Resolutions

-   Spend at least 30 minutes a day reading a good book
-   Run at least every other day
-   Write a post every week for this blog
-   Do more things outside
-   Limit my screen time
-   Drink more water


## Spring Classes

-   Indoor Plants
-   Professionalism in Computing
-   Computer Systems
-   Applied Mathematical Modelling
-   Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Capstone
