<p>One neat way to picture our world is in terms of timelines and threads, where a timeline is the typical length of time it takes for an object to react to and manipulate its environment, and a thread is an individual operating within that timeline. The different timelines that come to mind are for plants (that perceive life in terms of minutes to days), animals (seconds to minutes), and computers (nanoseconds or faster).</p>

<p>Each timeline comes with its complexities, demonstrated by the billions of human threads in our timeline getting constantly intertwined and pulled apart, spawning and eventually ceasing to exist. Looking at how threads in different timelines interact adds in a new layer of complexity that makes the situation that much more interesting. Learning how to harness the advantages that come with each timeline is part of what has made us so strong as a species.</p>

<p>The plants around you have no direct perception of your existence. Pull off some leaves and it will not defend itself, but pull it back from a sunny window and after a few hours you’ll notice that its leaves have tilted toward the sun. Though the plant does not have our metabolism, it has the ability to create and store energy through photosynthesis, showing that there are advantages to both.</p>

<p>Plants and animals evolved to survive in their timeline, but computers are special in that they were created by us to take advantage of the timeline in which electrons move. Computations that take humans months take computers only seconds, making our timeline to computers comparable to a plant’s timeline to ours.</p>

<p>I find that the sense of fascination I get from looking closely at plants is similar to the feelings I get when I run programs on a computer. With the plants, I picture the growth and movement happening before my eyes that I am unable to detect. With the computer, I imagine the millions of instructions executed in each passing second, some of which I have written myself, but many more that I am only vaguely aware of.</p>

<p>Perspective is everything when living in a world that operates on so many timelines, and knowing that every day we interface with objects that operate on timelines running concurrent to–yet apart from–our own is really cool.</p>
