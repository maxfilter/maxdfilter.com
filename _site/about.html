          <p>As a kid I always asked questions, motivated by the desire to understand how our world works. Though my interests have shifted over the years, my curiosity remains strong. I built this website as a place to answer questions and document my thoughts. My hope is that these posts will inspire you to think differently about the world we live in and ask more questions.</p>

Music and coffee get me through each day.</p>
