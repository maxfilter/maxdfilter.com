  <h1>Learning Through Discomfort</h1>

  <p>Since high school, I have been experimenting with different learning techniques—from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> to drawing every topic I’d learned in IB math on a single poster. What I realized during my endless pursuit of knowledge is that I learn best when my learning is paired with discomfort.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not talking about writing all of my essays in an ice bath (although I’m sure that anything you managed to concentrate on in that period of time would be <em>very</em> memorable). In my experience, discomfort has taken the form of late nights debugging my programs and trying to understand what the hell is going on when all I want to do is sleep, or surrounding myself with smart and talented people that inspire me to always try my hardest.</p>

<p>Halfway through my freshman year in high school, I moved to Spain. The education overlapped in some subjects, but was completely different in other areas. I was faced with a choice: finish freshman year and re-learn some of the subjects, or skip into sophomore year  and play catch-up for all of the material that I hadn’t yet covered.</p>

<p>My decision to skip a grade put me in a position where I needed to study what the other kids were learning while also trying to grasp the fundamentals of the subject. Going into college, I was an average senior with average grades, but I’d also acquired the ability to pick up new material on the fly and suffer with topics that came easy to other students.</p>

<p>This came in particularly handy when I decided to major in Computer Science. The first year was painful, since I had no prior experience programming and understood none of the basics. I would watch others writing the same programs as me and wonder what was going on in their minds and how they could just know what to do. The same was happening in physics and chemistry. I felt like I wasn’t just trying to learn the material, I was also trying to learn how to learn.</p>

<p>I’m a junior now, and over the past three years I have gone from having never written a line of code to being one of those students I admired before who can just mess with a program until it works. I still spend countless hours suffering in the middle of the night stepping through the debugger, trying to figure out what my mistakes are, but I’m at a point where broken programs no longer scare me. I see these moments of pain as learning opportunities, and though they suck in the moment, once I get past them I find myself with a much deeper understanding than if it had just worked on the first try.</p>

<p>I think this is an important observation, because we’re in a society that emphasizes the result and not the process. Being average is bad. Struggling is a sign of weakness. Discomfort is no longer desirable, and if you’re not great at something the first time you try it, then you should try something else. By looking at discomfort as a means to an end, rather than an end itself, gives one the ability to learn things that they never thought possible.</p>
